"Data: Here is the UCI Machine learning repository, which contains a large collection of standard datasets for testing learning algorithms. If you want to see examples of recent work in machine learning, start by taking a look at the conferences NeurIPS (all old NeurIPS papers are online) and ICML. Some other related conferences include UAI, AAAI, IJCAI.",,,,,,,
